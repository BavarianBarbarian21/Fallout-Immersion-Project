Robco_bodiesdef :
For the shield to be possible to add on mechs they need to have a "torso" 
Just added the torso tag to the groups of all the RobCo_Chassis

Line 209

Robco_FactionsPatch : 
This one is a personnal preference suggestion you do you : 
- Fixed the text (mentionned mechlink, replaced by pipboy) 
- Made the text one line 
Line 93

- Changed the vertibird landing boss group. From termite or pickman to a mix of 
Protectron + eyebot
Gutsty + eyebot
Cyberdog + eyebot
Seemed alrightish in my testing, didn't try in a real game but the fight sounded fair.
Line 104-135

Robco_RaidPatch: 
Another personnal preference to a bug fix (also I got lazy) 
Switched the patch operation to replace the summon action from biotech mech with the robco version rather than add on top of it. 
The less lazy solution would be to create a set of 4 items for the 4 summoning event (like you did for one of them) as once you summon it triggers both event regardless of which one you used to trigger but ... I don't care about biotech if I have robco so I opted to just disable them for now.
