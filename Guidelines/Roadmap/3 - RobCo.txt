FCP Robotics Mod Roadmap:

Inspiration of the mod is the vanilla expanded mod series philosophy.
Aim of the mod is to replace the vanilla RimWorld mechs with FCP Fallout robots under the following assumptions:
a) Players like the vanilla mech core Gameplay.
b) Players want an immersive Fallout world.
c) Players want more Content.
So the Goal will be to refit the core mech Content into the FCP Setting while adding new Content without straying too much from vanilla.
Mechs Combat strength in General will be nerfed. Fallout Robots are not the end game enemies RimWorld Mechs want to be.
Mech Research will be slighty expanded to expand vanilla Gameplay. 
Mechs can be used by other factions.

Additional content/FCP mod crossover unlockable Content:

Players can only have one Commander Bot at a time.
These Command Bots are unlocked in the Following Research Projects which unlock these robots of the given tech Levels. "I." means it's tech Level 1, Basic Mechtech aka Basic RobCo Circuitry. 

RobCo:
III.	Securitron MK2
IV.		Liberty Prime
(Securitrons can switch modes between Warden and Soldier, Warden has non leathal weapons, soldier has leathal weapons, can do Warden job activities. 
Liberty Prime is a giant commander combat robot, Charge Attack)

Chinese Remnants:
I. 		Liberator
IV.		Warmachine
(Liberator are extremly weak but cheap laser and melee mechs to be used in a swarm.
Warmachine is a giant commander combat robot that boosts the effect of all nearby liberators making liberators slightly stronger than Mister gutsy but cheaper when used in this combination.)

Big Mt. Robotics:
I. 		Robo Scorpion
IV. 	Giant Robo Scorpion
(Robo Scorpions are weak and cheap melee and laser mechs to be used in a swarm.
Giant Robo Scorpion commander combat robot that boosts Robo Scorpions slightly and can spawn up to three Robo Scorpions)

Big Mt. Cyborgs:
III.	Think Tank
IV. 	Golitath
(Optional, Think Tank would probably be better off as a playable race with the ability to turn pawns into think tanks by extracting their brain at the ripperscanner.
Goliath is a giant commander combat robot that can create storms and has a lightning strike charge ability.)

Institute:
II.		Gen 1 Synth
III.	Gen 2 Synths
(Optional, Early Synths could work as mechanoids with the ability to make Gen 3 Synth playable pawns, or All Synths can be playbale non mechanoid pawns.
As mechs Gen 1 Synths could be capable of all easy jobs like mining, Gen 2 all complexe work like crafting, Gen 3 all work including research which 1 and 2 are incapable of. None can do art.)

Vault 0:
I.		Scurry Bot
IV.		Pacificator
(Scurry bot are extremely weak but cheap to make swarm mechs.
Pacificator is a giant commander combat robot with a very long range minigun, boosts Scurry bots slightly, spawns scurry bots)

Optionnal: Vendotron (Hospitality Mod), Assistant Robot(Lifter mechanoid, but ugly and unknown to most players), Automatrons (Making your own robots FCP Automatron mod), Behemoth (too similiar to liberators and name is confusing with Super Mutant Behemoths), Cargobot (mechanoid that is unable to attack or move but drops lots of loot, can be dropped in via crash pod and just lay there as a form of quest reward), Variety of Alien drones (meh, but could be made into a commander Research project with the F76 alien enemies), Gun robot, Gun emplacement, hover robot, humanoid robot, kamikaze robot, laser robot, loadlifter robot, maintenance robot, The Motherlode, security robot, Service Robot (Could be funny), spider drone, tank track robot, tesla robot, Vertibot (Could be useful), All kinds of turrets.
