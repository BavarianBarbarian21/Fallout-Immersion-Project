    <description>When the bombs fell, the East Coast’s dense cities became tombs of glass and steel.
      Those who endured the fallout adapted to life in shattered high-rises and flooded metro
      tunnels. The Atlantic people are resourceful, tech-savvy scavengers who learned to thrive
      amidst rust, rain, and radiation. They speak with the echo of a thousand pre-war voices,
      clinging to fragments of the old world’s ambition.</description>
    <descriptionShort>Urban survivors from the irradiated ruins of the East Coast, hardened by
      concrete jungles and endless storms.</descriptionShort>
