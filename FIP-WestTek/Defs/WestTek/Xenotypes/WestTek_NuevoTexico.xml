    <label>Nuevo Texico</label>
    <description>In the ashes of the Southwest, the Rio Grande became a lifeline for those who
      refused to die divided. Nuevo Texico rose from the union of Americans and Mexicans who shed
      the old borders. Their blood carries two nations, their speech blends two tongues, and their
      culture is a hymn to survival, sung in both sun and dust.</description>
    <descriptionShort>Descendants of the Rio Grande survivors where borders vanished and survival
      united all.</descriptionShort>
