      <description>Wastelanders are the backbone of the post-nuclear world. Neither mutants nor
        vault-born, they are scavengers, traders, raiders, and settlers who made the open scars of
        the earth their home. Every scar tells a story, every bruise a lesson. They are the living
        testament that humanity can survive anythingâ€”even itself.</description>
