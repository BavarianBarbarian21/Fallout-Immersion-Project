  <description>Donaustahl, from Bavaria with Love. This mod is the optional cherry on top of my other mods, for when you want a full Fallout Immersion. It removes all unimmersive aspects of Rimworld which were not already changed by my other FIP mods. IF you want vanilla mechanoids or vanilla factions in your game DO NOT download this mod, and simply stick to the other FIP mods.</description>
