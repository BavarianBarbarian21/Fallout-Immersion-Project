    <label>Rough Arizona Settlement</label>
    <description>The Rough Arizona Settlement is a loose collection of survivors hardened by the wasteland’s brutality. They value grit over grace, and survival over civility. Life here is harsh — trade is bartered through intimidation, disputes are settled with fists or gunfire, and law depends on who’s standing last. Despite their rough edges, they’ve carved out a functioning, if volatile, society where toughness earns respect and weakness finds no quarter.</description>

    <label>Arizona Raider</label>
    <description>The Arizona Raider Gang thrives on chaos and plunder. Forged in the ashes of civilization, they scavenge, raid, and rule through fear. Their members are scarred, loud, and proud of their savagery, painting their armor with the symbols of past kills. They move in convoys of patched-together vehicles, hitting trade routes and settlements for supplies, slaves, or sport. To them, the wasteland isn’t a tragedy — it’s freedom without rules.</description>

    <label>Arizona Tribe</label>
    <description>The Arizona Tribe traces its roots to survivors who turned back to the old ways when the world fell apart. They live close to the land, guided by oral tradition, ancestor worship, and a deep respect for the cycles of nature. Though primitive by modern standards, they are skilled hunters, gatherers, and healers who blend salvaged pre-war tools with tribal craftsmanship. They defend their territory fiercely but trade fairly with outsiders — if they prove worthy of trust.</description>
